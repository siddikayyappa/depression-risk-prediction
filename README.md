# Depression Risk Prediction
This is the source code in python, written to build a classifier, which would predict the risk of an individual being depressed, with the help of their music listening history.

## The Idea in a Nutshell
A lot can be said about the mental health of a person by looking at their choice of music and how much repetitively listen to the same music over and over again. In the same fashion, a lot can be said about a piece of music, with it's lyrics (if they exist). We predict the risk of an individual being at the risk of depression with the help of their music listening history. We have collected data about various individuals and their music listening histories from LAST.FM. We aim to create a classifier with the player stats, Lyrical content, playcount etc. 

## Something else to try
A recommender system which suggests music for people based on their risk of being in depression.
